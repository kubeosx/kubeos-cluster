# GitOps-Enabled Repository with Flux CD

Welcome to the GitOps-enabled repository for managing Kubernetes resources using Flux CD. This repository automates the deployment of essential tools, including Prometheus, Grafana, Flux, Vault, Kyverno, and Crossplane, to your connected Kubernetes cluster.

## Overview

This repository is designed to streamline the management of Kubernetes resources, ensuring consistent and automated deployments while maintaining version control. By leveraging Flux CD, you can achieve GitOps practices, allowing you to define your desired cluster state in Git, and Flux will make it a reality in your cluster.

## Key Features

### Prometheus

- **Monitoring**: Collect and monitor metrics from your Kubernetes cluster.
- **Alerting**: Configure alerting rules to be notified of potential issues.

### Grafana

- **Visualization**: Create custom dashboards and visualize Kubernetes metrics.
